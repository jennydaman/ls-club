# Wootton Linux (Systems/Software) Club 2017-2018

This Github repository provides various resources for the club.

**Founder**: Jennings Zhang

**Teacher Sponsor**: Mr. Erin Marshall

**Room**: 15 networking lab (next to the cafeteria)

We meet **every Tuesday after-school from 14:40 to 15:30**, with the occasional exception. 

## Git workflow

- `master` branch `/docs` folder contains the *Jekyll* source for the **live version** of the (Github) website (https://jennydaman.github.io/twlinux/)
- `next` branch includes **unpublished** material concerning the topic of next week's meetings.
- `future` branch outlines the **tentative long-term agenda** for this club.

`master` should be merged into the development branches to keep them up to date and in sync. `next` should only be merged into `master` when its ready for publication. `future` should usually *never be merged* into other branches. Instead, checkout individual files from the future branch when they're ready to be worked on in next. (Most features in `future` are expected to be unstable or incomplete.)

*DFTBA.*
