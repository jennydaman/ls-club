# Desktop environment

The graphical user interface of *NIX operating systems are managed by an "X server".

[GNOME 3](https://www.gnome.org/) is the most popular desktop environment on Linux.

#### GNOME extensions

<https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShellIntegrationForChrome/Installation>

GNOME extensions can be downloaded and managed from <https://extensions.gnome.org/>, or through [GNOME Tweaks](https://packages.ubuntu.com/zesty/gnome-tweak-tool) (`gnome-tweak-tool`). 

# Filesystem Hierarchy Standard

- `/` is the root of the filesystem, which holds all your system files.
- `/home` is where your user's directory is located. You have write access to your home folder only. Your home folder is denoted as `~` (tilde) by most shells, and it contains your documents, pictures, configurations, and other ordinary files.
- `/bin` is a symlink to `/usr/bin`, which contains executable binaries.
- `/boot` contains static files for the bootloader.
- `/dev` holds "block devices". Physical and logical devices can be interacted with through their block devices in `/dev`.
    - `/dev/sda` represents the first physical drive.
    - `/dev/sda1` is the first partition on that drive.
    - `/dev/null` is a pseudo-device that behaves much like `null` in any context of computer science. It discards any data written to it. 
- `/etc/` contains configuration files.
- `/lib` holds shared libraries.
- `/usr` is a seconday heirarchy containing mostly read-only data. 

See `man hier` or <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard> for details.

# System administration

It is safer to use text-mode text editors and basic utilities to manipulate system files.

Set `SUDO_EDITOR` in your `.bashrc` file:

```sh
export SUDO_EDITOR=nano
```

`nano` is an easy-to-understand text-mode text editor. (I actually recommend `vim` and `SUDO_EDITOR=rvim`, however `vim` is very advanced and is probably confusing.)

## systemd 

Systemd is the default [`init`](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/sect_04_02.html) solution to many modern Linux distros. It manages daemons (background services).

`systemd-analyze blame` reports the services that started at boot, in descending order of CPU time.

`systemctl disable --now [SERVICE]` ends a daemon and stops it from starting on boot.
