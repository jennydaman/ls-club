## Solus 3

On some computers, I installed Solus 3, which is an independent Linux distribution. What we worked with last week is Elementary 0.4, which is based on Ubuntu 16.04. Solus is more lightweight than Elementary, and in my opinion, its desktop environment looks better. 

However, Solus is a community project, while Ubuntu is sponsored by Canonical, a company which made more than 50 million of profit in the year of 2013. Because of this, Solus' software repository is considerably small, though it is enough for what we do. 

Besides having an awesome desktop environment, the only difference you'll notice is that the command to manage packages is `eopkg` instead of `apt`.

- `echo Hello world!`
- `ls DIR`
- `cd DIR`
- `mkdir DIR`
- `rmdir DIR`
- `rm FILE`
- `touch FILE`
- `cat`
    - `cat FILE`
    - `cat > FILE`
- `man COMMAND`
- `sudo COMMAND`
- `apt`

# Shell

The shell is the program that interprets input and executes commands to get output. The default shell on many Linux distributions is bash. 

# Tips and tricks

`.` represents the current working directory, while `..` represents the parent directory. 

`*` represents a wild card. 

# Things to try 

`sudo apt install sl` or `sudo eopkg it sl`

`sl`

sl runs a steam locomotive in your terminal. 

`man sl`

`sl -alFc`


A Linux command usually follows this format: 

`command [--option -f] parameter`

A more advanced command goes like this: 

`VAR=something command [--option setting] [-f] parameter PIPE secondcommand`

A pipe redirects input and output of commands. 

1. `sudo apt install lolcat screenfetch` or `sudo eopkg it ruby screenfetch && gem install lolcat`
2. `man screenfetch`
3. `man lolcat`
4. `screenfetch | lolcat`

The vertical bar pipe directs the output of the first program to the input stream of the second program. 

The right angle braket, or greater than sign, dumps the output of a program to a text file. 

`cat > FILE`

# nano and vim 

text based editors 

# System configuration 

Budgie users can change the desktop settings. 

Go fish, the friendly interactive shell.
